The main function contains two primary loops:

The game loop:
This while loop continues running until either the user or the computer
has no remaining ships. Inside this loop, the player and computer boards
are displayed, and turns for the user and computer are handled.

a. User's turn loop:
This loop prompts the user to input their guess (row and column) for
a ship on the computer's board. It keeps asking for input until
the user provides a valid guess (a location that hasn't been guessed before).
Afterward, the loop checks if the guess is a hit or a miss, updates
the computer's board, and adjusts the scores and remaining ships accordingly.

b. Computer's turn loop:
This loop generates random guesses for the computer's turn.
It keeps generating new guesses until a valid guess
(a location that hasn't been guessed before) is found.
The loop then checks if the guess is a hit or a miss on the user's board,
updates the user's board,
and adjusts the scores and remaining ships accordingly.

After the game loop ends, the main function prints the game results,
indicating whether the user or the computer has won the game."""
